# Commit-msg

## Scripts

- gerrit: pretty sure is a default gerrit script to add change id and commit owner info (gerrit.commit-msg)

### Gerrit

##### Description

Inserts change-id and commit owner info into commit message. (haven't really used it, added just in case)

##### Requirements

None (?) other than using gerrit
